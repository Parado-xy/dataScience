The `sklearn.linear_model.Ridge` model in scikit-learn is a type of linear regression model that includes regularization. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the size of the coefficients. Ridge regression is also known as L2 regularization.

Here are the key aspects of the `Ridge` model:

1. **Objective Function**: Ridge regression minimizes the following objective function:
   
   \[
   \text{minimize} \left( \| y - Xw \|^2_2 + \alpha \| w \|^2_2 \right)
   \]
   
   where:
   - \( y \) is the vector of target values.
   - \( X \) is the matrix of input features.
   - \( w \) is the vector of coefficients (weights).
   - \( \alpha \) is the regularization strength (a hyperparameter).
   - \(\| w \|^2_2\) is the L2 norm (sum of the squares of the coefficients).

2. **Regularization Strength (`alpha`)**: The parameter `alpha` controls the amount of regularization applied to the model. A higher value of `alpha` increases the regularization strength, which can help reduce overfitting but may also lead to underfitting. Conversely, a lower value of `alpha` reduces the regularization effect, making the model closer to ordinary least squares regression.

3. **Implementation**: The `Ridge` model can be implemented in scikit-learn as follows:

   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
   
   # Create a Ridge regression model
   ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
   
   # Fit the model to the data
   ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)
   
   # Make predictions
   y_pred = ridge.predict(X_test)
   ```

4. **Attributes**:
   - `coef_`: The coefficients (weights) of the linear model.
   - `intercept_`: The intercept of the linear model.

5. **Methods**:
   - `fit(X, y)`: Fit the model to the training data.
   - `predict(X)`: Predict target values for new data.
   - `score(X, y)`: Return the coefficient of determination \( R^2 \) of the prediction.

6. **Advantages**:
   - Can handle multicollinearity (correlated features) better than ordinary least squares regression.
   - Helps in preventing overfitting by introducing a penalty for large coefficients.

7. **Limitations**:
   - Requires tuning of the regularization parameter `alpha`.
   - May not perform well if the true relationship between the features and target is highly non-linear.

In summary, `sklearn.linear_model.Ridge` is a powerful tool for linear regression that incorporates regularization to improve generalization and robustness, particularly in the presence of multicollinearity among features.
